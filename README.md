<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To sucessfully complete this tutorial you should: 
<ul>
  <li>have an active AWS Account.</li>
  <li>basic understanding of Unix terminal commands.</li>
  <li>basic understanding of Docker.</li>
</ul>
If you say yes to all these requirements, we can start.
</p>

<h2>How to read this tutorial?</h2>
<p>This tutorial provides clear steps and commands which must be executed sequentially as it is listed. I strongly recommend not to skip any step, except <i>Workaround</i> step if all forward commands will no raise any errors.</p>

<h2>Hands on set up your AWS EC2 Instances</h2>
<p>In this part we will closely work on initialzied AWS EC2 instances. Keep in mind that in order to complete this part sucessfully, you should be opened all 3 terminal windows during all steps. Here 1 terminal window is dedicated to <b>Master slave</b>, while other two to <b>Worker nodes</b>. So in total we are having 3 nodes (1 + 2).<br>Noticing that this manual was prepared in Mac, so slightly differences may be using different OS, such as Windows.</p>

<h3>Step 0. Prepare your SSH Private key for safe connections</h3>
<p>First of all, put you SSH key to a special folder in your machine. Keep SSH key filnename be easy to type and recognize such as <i>kubernetes-dev.pem</i> (we will use this filename furthermore in this manual).</p>
<p>Before all forwarding steps, you must to allow your <i>.pem</i> file be executable in your system. To do this, type and enter following command:</p>

```
chmod 400 kubernetes-dev.pem 
```

As a result you should see granted access to your <i>.pem</i> file - type <code>ls -la</code> command to see the effect:

```commandline
-r--------@    1 usename  staff   1700 Nov 16 07:14 kubernetes-dev.pem
```
This setting ensure safe connection to instances to execute next steps. 
</p>

<h3>Step 1. Install dependencies and configure Kubernetes</h3>
<p>
In this part we will install Docker and Kubernetes packages into all 3 nodes, then enable them to work. In addition to that we will prepare Kubernetes tools such as <code>kubectl</code>, and <code>kubeadm</code> once they are mandatory for set up.
</p>
<p><b><u>Important:</b> Following steps must be executed in all your nodes, included Master and Worker nodes in paraller.</u></p>

<p><b>Step 1.1. Install Docker</b><br>
In order to install Docker package to your node, type and enter following commands:

```commandline
# 1. Install Docker 
# 1.1. Update the package list
sudo apt-get update
# 1.2. Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io
# 1.3. Check the installation and Docker version
docker --version
```
</p>

<p><b>Step 1.2. Start and enable Docker</b><br>
Once you installed Docker in a previous step, you should to start and enable for a work it by type and enter following commands.
  
```commandline
# 2. Start and Enable Docker
# 2.1. Set Docker to launch at boot
sudo systemctl enable docker
# 2.2. Verify that Docker is running now
sudo systemctl status docker
# 2.3. If not running, try this:
sudo systemctl start docker
```
  
</p>
